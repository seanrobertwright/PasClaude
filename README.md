# pasclaude

A terminal coding agent for Windows, written in Free Pascal. It talks to the
Anthropic messages API, streams the reply as it arrives, and lets the model
read, search, edit and run things in your project - asking before anything is
changed.

No dependencies beyond the FPC RTL: HTTPS is WinHTTP bound at runtime, JSON is
a small DOM in `uJson`, and the console is driven through the Win32 API.

```
pasclaude 0.1
  E:\Projects\pascal\pasclaude
  claude-sonnet-4-20250514
  /help for commands, /exit to quit

> what does uHttp do, and is the timeout long enough for streaming?
  * read src\uHttp.pas
    ...
uHttp is a thin WinHTTP wrapper: one POST, streamed to a callback...
```

## Build

```
build            :: release (optimised, stripped) -> bin\pasclaude.exe
build debug      :: with line-info for backtraces
build clean
```

Requires Free Pascal 3.2.x for `x86_64-win64`. The script finds `fpc.exe` on
`PATH`, or under `C:\lazarus\fpc\*` / `C:\FPC\*`.

## Run

```
set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
set ANTHROPIC_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-20250514   :: optional
bin\pasclaude.exe [directory]
```

The directory argument (default: the current one) becomes the *session root*.
Every path the model asks for is resolved against it and refused if it would
escape, so the agent cannot wander into `C:\Windows` because it misread a
relative path.

If the project contains `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md` or `.pasclaude.md`, the
contents are appended to the system prompt as binding instructions.

## Commands

| Command | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `/help` | list the commands |
| `/clear` | forget the conversation so far |
| `/cwd` | show the session root |
| `/model [name]` | show or change the model |
| `/yolo` | approve every tool for the rest of the session |
| `/cost` | turns and tokens used |
| `/exit` | quit (Ctrl+C also works) |

## Tools

| Tool | Approval | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `read_file` | no | output is line-numbered, capped at 400 KB |
| `list_dir` | no | skips `.git` and `node_modules`, max depth 4 |
| `search` | no | case-insensitive content search, capped at 200 hits |
| `write_file` | yes | creates intermediate directories |
| `edit_file` | yes | exact-snippet replace; refuses an ambiguous match |
| `bash` | yes | `cmd.exe /C`, output merged, 120 s timeout |

At each prompt you can answer `y` (once), `a` (always, for that class of tool)
or `n`. Read-only tools never ask.

## Tests

```
fpc -MObjFPC -Scghi -Fusrc -FUbuild\units -obin\smoke.exe tests\smoke.lpr
bin\smoke.exe
```

Covers the JSON parser (escapes, surrogate pairs, malformed input, locale-proof
number formatting) and every tool including the path guard and the deny-by-
default permission path. The network layer is not covered.

## Design notes

| Unit | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `uJson` | JSON DOM: parse, build, serialise |
| `uHttp` | WinHTTP POST with the body delivered in chunks |
| `uTerm` | UTF-8 console output, colour, line editor |
| `uTools` | the tool implementations, path guard, permission gate |
| `uAgent` | request building, SSE decoding, the tool loop |
| `pasclaude.lpr` | REPL, slash commands, rendering |

Details worth knowing if you touch this code:

* **The tool loop is the whole point.** `TAgent.Send` posts the transcript,
  and if the reply contains `tool_use` blocks it runs them, appends the
  results as a user message, and posts again - up to `MaxToolRounds`. A turn
  ends only when the model stops asking for tools.
* **Content blocks are assembled outside the JSON DOM.** They stream as
  start/delta/stop triplets keyed by index, and `TJson` has no setters, so
  `uAgent` accumulates plain strings in an array and builds the message once.
  Tool arguments arrive as `input_json_delta` fragments that are only valid
  JSON once the last one lands.
* **Numbers are serialised with an invariant decimal point.** `FloatToStr`
  honours the locale, and on a machine set to a comma separator the request
  body would be malformed JSON.
* **`WriteConsoleW` fails on a redirected handle,** so `RawWrite` falls back
  to the plain stream. That is what makes `echo /help | pasclaude` work.
* **Permission defaults to deny.** `RunTool` takes a nil `Ask` in tests and in
  any non-interactive context, and a nil ask means no.
* **Thinking blocks carry a signature** that has to be echoed back verbatim
  on the next request, so it is captured from `signature_delta` and stored
  alongside the text.
